# Setting up EC2 instances for puppet

## Creating EC2 Key pair

1.	Login to AWS consle and open the Amazon EC2 console.
2.	In the top navigation bar, choose the region in the dropdown region selector.
    *  Region: Singapore/Sydney (ap-south-east-1/ap-southeast-2	a)
3.	In the left navigation pane, under Network and Security, click Key Pairs.
4.	Create Key Pair.

<br>


The private key file, which is named yourname_puppet.pem, will be downloaded on your machine. 
(You will need the private key file later to access the instances that we will create and launch with this key pair. If the key pair is lost, you will not be able to connect to the Amazon EC2 instances.)

## Creating Security Group
1.	In the left navigation pane, under Network and Security, click Security Groups.
2.	Create Security Group.

Setting Up Puppet on EC2 Instances (Additional instructions will be provided during the class)


SSH into Puppet <b>Master</b> server via Jupyter Notebook Terminal

```
chmod 400 <your key pair>.pem 
ssh -i <key pair>.pem ubuntu@<ec2 puppet master server public dns>
```

SSH into Puppet <b>Agent/Slave</b> server via Jupyter Notebook Terminal

```
ssh -i <key pair>.pem ubuntu@<ec2 puppet slave server public dns>
```



Assign a hostname for the Puppet Master EC2 instance

### Master
```
sudo hostname <public dns>
```


Assign a hostname for the Puppet Agent EC2 instance

### Agent/Slave
```
sudo hostname <public dns>
```


Resolve domain names without using Domain Name System

Verify the IP address for the Puppet Master EC2 Instance, check against the AWS EC2 dashboard
```
ifconfig
```


Verify the IP address for the Puppet Agent EC2 Instance, check against the AWS EC2 dashboard
```
ifconfig
```


On Puppet Master EC2 Instance, perform the following steps:
* Login as root
* Add a Puppet Master private host entry
* Update the system's package manager
* Install puppet master

### Master

Obtain the private ip and dns from the AWS EC2 dashboard. (Master)

```
sudo su -

echo <private ip> <private dns> >> /etc/hosts

apt-get update

apt-get install puppetmaster -y
```

Kindly perform the command below to label the master server prompt
```
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Search the following line 
```
PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
```
Change the existing line to below  
```
PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\ master $ '
```
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

On Puppet Agent EC2 Instance, perform the following steps:
* Login as root
*	Add a Puppet Master/Private host entry
* Update the system's package manager
* Install puppet

### Agent/Slave

Obtain the private ip and dns from the AWS EC2 dashboard (Agent/Slave)

```
sudo su -

echo <private ip> <private dns> >> /etc/hosts
echo <master private ip> <master private dns> >> /etc/hosts
echo <master public ip> <master public dns> >> /etc/hosts
apt-get update

apt-get install puppet -y
```

Kindly perform the command below to label the slave server prompt
```
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Search the following line 
```
PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\$ '
```
Change the existing line to below  
```
PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@\h:\w\ slave $ '
```
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
Configure Puppet Agent to be able to communicate with Puppet Master through the Puppet's configuration file puppet.conf located under the /etc/puppet directory on the Puppet Agent Linux operating system.

Add a server entry to the end of the [main] configuration section of the puppet.conf file. Important take note this must the public DNS server name if not the issue certification service won't work.

### Agent/Slave

```
[Main]
server = <master public dns>

[agent]
runinterval = 5m
```


Testing your puppet environment

Puppet uses SSL certificates to authenticate communication between master and agent nodes. The Puppet master acts as a certificate authority (CA). Our master generates its own certificates which is used to sign agent certificate requests.
By default, the Puppet client runs as a daemon, and the puppet agent command forks off the Puppet daemon into the background and exits immediately. The first time Puppet runs on an agent node, it will send a certificate signing request to the Puppet master. Before the master will be able to communicate and control the agent node, it must sign that particular agent node's certificate. 
Puppet Agent request for cert from Puppet Master


### Agent/Slave
Start the pupper service and also check the status of the service after issuing the start command

```
service puppet start
service puppet status
puppet agent --enable
```

### Master
Start the pupper service and also check the status of the service after issuing the start command

```
service puppet start
service puppet status
```


### Agent/Slave
```
puppet agent --no-daemonize --onetime --verbose
puppet agent --test -d
```

Checking the list of certificates and cert requests on Puppet Master

### Master

Puppet Master sign cert request from Puppet Agent/Slave

```
puppet cert list -all
puppet cert sign --all
```

Puppet manifests are made up of a number of major components:
1.	Resources: Individual configuration items
2.	Files: Physical files you can serve out to your agents
3.	Templates: Template files that you can use to populate files
4.	Nodes: Specifies the configuration of each agent
5.	Classes: Collections of resources
6.	Definitions: Composite collections of resources

Create a pp file and modules on the Puppet Master node that tells Puppet where and what configuration to load for our clients in the etc/puppet/code manifests directory.

### Master 
```
cd /etc/puppet/code

mkdir environments

cd environments

mkdir production

cd production

mkdir modules

mkdir manifests

cd manifests
```

Create a site.pp file that navigate to the custom module 

### Master 

```
nano site.pp
```

Enter the codes to the site pp file

```
node "default" {
  include modulea
}
```

To save press Ctrl + x and answer yes to save

Create puppet module directory structure

### Master 
```
cd ../modules

mkdir modulea

cd  modulea

mkdir files 

mkdir manifests

cd files 

touch test.txt

cd .. 

cd manifests

nano init.pp

```

Create a module class init.pp file. Paste the below codes into the init.pp

### Master 
```
class modulea {
file { '/home/ubuntu':
        ensure => directory,
        owner => 'ubuntu',
        group => 'ubuntu',
}

package { 'htop':
    ensure => installed,
}

exec { "apt-update":
  command => "/usr/bin/apt-get update"
}

exec { "install-dep":
  command => "/usr/bin/apt-get --yes install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common"
}

exec { "curl-docker":
  command => "/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -"
}

exec { "add-docker-dep":
  command => "/usr/bin/add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable'"
}

Exec["apt-update"] -> Package <| |>
Exec["install-dep"] -> Package <| |>
Exec["curl-docker"] -> Package <| |>
Exec["add-docker-dep"] -> Package <| |>
Exec["apt-update"] -> Package <| |>

package { 'docker-ce':
    ensure => installed,
}


file { "/home/ubuntu/test.txt":
        mode => "0644",
        owner => 'ubuntu',
        group => 'ubuntu',
        source => "puppet:///modules/modulea/test.txt",
    }
}

```
To save press Ctrl + x and answer yes to save

On the Puppet Agent node, sync with Puppet Master node.

### Agent/Slave
```
puppet agent --test -d 
```

## Troubleshooting

Unable to sign certificate from the slave
```
Error: Could not request certificate: The certificate retrieved from the master does not match the agent's private key. Did you forget to run as root?
Certificate fingerprint: E0:F6:92:CE:96:A5:D1:9C:4B:DB:0D:66:31:FF:04:C1:04:A2:65:67:BD:21:52:BF:CD:D0:F8:DD:E0:7F:47:65
To fix this, remove the certificate from both the master and the agent and then start a puppet run, which will automatically regenerate a certificate.
On the master:
  puppet cert clean ec2-63-33-70-42.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
On the agent:
  1a. On most platforms: find /var/lib/puppet/ssl -name ec2-63-33-70-42.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com.pem -delete
  1b. On Windows: del "\var\lib\puppet\ssl\certs\ec2-63-33-70-42.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com.pem" /f
  2. puppet agent -t
```
